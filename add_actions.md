I want to add more complex actions onto the game.

- When a card is selected, the effects should happen in order.
- When a user selects a card with an effect which requires user input, action buttons should appear as well as prompt for what user can do (basically the cards effect).
  - There should be a cancel action which undoes all effects of the card done so far
     - This means if the user had selected a card which reduces one action then trashed one card then hits cancel, that card should come back from trash, then one action refunded.
  - There should be a finish action which ends the action early if users chooses not to perform all actions
     - If a card allows a user to trash up to 3 cards, they may choose finish after trashing 2 cards for example.
- There is a new concept: Trash
  - Trash is the ability for the player to select a card from their hand.
  - Trashed cards are removed from the game, not put into the discard.
- New cards
  - 10x Cleanup - Cost 3 gold

    - User can trash up to 3 cards from their hand
  - 10x Search - Cost 4 fold
    - -1 action for player
    - Draw 3 cards to player
  - 10x Repurpose - Cost 2 gold
    - Discard any number of cards.
    - For each card discarded another card is drawn
    - Note: all discards must happen before the drawn is done
  - 10x Everything - Cost 5 gold
    - Draw 1 card to player
    - +1 buy for the player

    - Trash a card, then the user can gain a card from shop costing up to 2 more than card cost
